For adding something like this, there is a lighter weight way.<EOL>
Only committers need to sign an ICLA, and software grants are only needed separately for large blobs of pre-existing code.<EOL>
When we''re in Apache, you can contribute by putting it on the Jena JIRA as a patch file.<EOL>
This implies the necessary legal permission for ASF to use the patch just by the act of doing it (the Jira installation has a note about this when you create the entry, I think - we''re all a bit new to Apache processes).<EOL>
Some committer then handles it - I think (we new to this ...) by making sure the project group is OK with it and then applying the patch.<EOL>
Or the other way round.<EOL>
The point is an email goes to the public development mailing list for everyone, inc committers, to see. <EOL>
For added examples, it''s a bit of a no-op, but it means it''s ""the project"" dciding, not one person in isolation.<EOL>
It''s no work for the contributor - they just upload patch to JIRA.<EOL>
We''d be swamped by (electronic) paperwork otherwise.<EOL>
The full details are:http://www.apache.org/foundation/getinvolved.html.<EOL>
